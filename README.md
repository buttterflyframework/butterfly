Butterfly
=========

Butterfly is designed to help developers focus on being productive, instead of spending time (and money) looking for different libraries to fit their needs. The core library provides an AMD engine to build SPA websites, MVC support to help you organize your code, abstract caching layer for extra performance, responsive layout support for supporting mobile and tablets, huge set of UI controls, and many extra features you'll learn as you progress. 

Setup
=========

The suggested installation option is using Bower:

`bower install butterflyjs`

For those who like to setup stuff manually, feel free to download the latest version directly from github or the webpage using the following links:
